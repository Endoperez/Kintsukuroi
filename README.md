# Kintsukuroi
An Android Experiment game inspired by the Japanese art of Kintsukuroi
By Chelsea Saunders (pixelatedcrown) with music by Clark Powell

This project was built with Unity 5 - select "Open Other" from the inital Unity screen and select the included 
"unity" folder as the folder.

Locations of interest:
- The C# scripts [Kintsukuroi/unity/Assets/Scripts/]
- The vessel models [Kintsukuroi/unity/Assets/Models/Vessels/]

The main scripts include:
- VesselScript (deals with the vessels, namely during gameplay as well as gameplay itself)
- UIScript (deals with the UI display throughout the game)
- MusicScript (deals with all the music in-game)
- GlobalValues (used for holding variables that are shared across scripts)
- GameModes (controls the differences between Normal and Timed gameplay modes)
- DeletePlayerPrefs (strictly for deleting player preferences when it comes to deleting save data)
